# EPAR EMITTER HACK
## The Eagle project of the epar project


**(c) Found the entire project here : http://furrtek.free.fr/?a=epar**

## Included:
1. All needed files to modify the project
2. BOM
3. Modified firmware (See in firmware folder)


 ## For futher
As we know, only 350 cities (minimum), have been equipped with this system, (which makes 10% of the total cities in France). To have this famous cities code which is coded on 8 bits (so 255 possibilities), it is necessary to scan the frequencies 31MHz to 32MHz, which is tedious, this repo proposes to you a "brut-force", the program has been modified so that the 255 possibilities are tested. Once you have the code you can directly inform it in the remote control, it will go faster. This is just the theory, I have not tried it yet, but I would update this readme as soon as I have some pretty big breakthroughs.
